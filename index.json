In critical domains like driving, these autonomous counterparts must be able to recount their actions for safety, liability, and trust.  An explanation: a model-dependent reason or justification for the decision of the autonomous agent being assessed, is a key component for post-mortem failure analysis, but also for pre-deployment verification.  I will show a monitoring framework that uses a model and commonsense knowledge to detect and explain unreasonable vehicle scenarios, even if it has not seen that error before.\nIn the second part of the talk, I will motivate the explanations as a testing framework for autonomous systems.  While it is important to develop realistic tests in simulation, simulation is not always representative of the corner cases in the real world.  I will show how to use explanations in a feedback loop.  The explanation ensures that the machine has done the right thing or it exploits a stressor to be modified and tested moving forward.  I will conclude by discussing new challenges at the intersection of XAI and autonomy towards autonomous systems that are explainable by design","tags":[],"title":"Explaining Errors in Autonomous Driving: A Diagnosis Tool and Testing Framework for Robust Decision Making","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Leilani H.

My novel contribution is a system-wide monitoring architecture, which is composed of introspective, overlapping committees of subsystems.  Each subsystem is encapsulated in a reasonableness monitor, an adaptable framework that supplements local decisions with commonsense data and reasonableness rules.  This framework is dynamic and introspective: it allows each subsystem to defend its decisions in different contexts; to the committees it participates in and to itself.  For reconciling system-wide errors, I developed a comprehensive architecture that I call Anomaly Detection through Explanations (ADE).  The ADE architecture contributes an explanation synthesizer that produces an argument tree, which in turn can be traced and queried to determine the support of a decision, and to construct counterfactual explanations.  I have applied this methodology to detect incorrect labels in semi-autonomous vehicle data, and to reconcile inconsistencies in simulated, anomalous driving scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Identifying Multimodal Errors Through Explanations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Zichao Li","Li Liu","Zeyu Wang","Yuyin Zhou","Cihang Xie"],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1599350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669193639,"objectID":"c76b8832d3883bc36e59fc83ff3e7e37","permalink":"https://zeyuwang615.github.io/publication/bag-of-tricks-at/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bag-of-tricks-at/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Bag of tricks for FGSM adversarial training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yutong Bai","**Zeyu Wang**","Junfei Xiao","Chen Wei","Huiyu Wang","Alan Yuille","Yuyin Zhou","Cihang Xie"],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1598313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669193639,"objectID":"ec04330db1479a868fe58166884cc43a","permalink":"https://zeyuwang615.github.io/publication/dmae/","publishdate":"2020-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dmae/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Masked Autoencoders Enable Efficient Knowledge Distillers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leilani H.
