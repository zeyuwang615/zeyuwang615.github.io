      <description>I am seeking creative, hard-working, prospective PhD students (and master&#39;s students and undergraduates) to join the XAI group at UCSC.
Come work with me on making complex mechanisms more understandable for debugging and diagnosis, accountability, and liability. We examine applications in autonomous driving, deep learning, and other mission-critical or safety-critical applications. Additionally, my work also examines the role of explanations for trustworthy ML, interpretable HCI, AI and ethics, and AI safety and fairness.</description>
